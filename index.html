<br>Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/">Prof. Chenyan Xiong</a>. My primary research interests are exploring novel ways to efficiently train and apply large language models in sample-limited and computation-limited scenarios. I am currently working on <strong>data curation</strong> and <strong>model preference</strong> for pre-training.<br><br>

Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a major in Computer Science and Technology. I was honored to be a member of <a href="http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">THUNLP</a>, advised by <a href="http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">Prof. Zhiyuan Liu</a>, working closely with <a href="https://gaotianyu.xyz/about/">Dr. Tianyu Gao</a> and <a href="https://zzy14.github.io/">Dr. Zhengyan Zhang</a> in prompting and few-shot learning. I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp">UWNLP</a>, advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/">Prof. Sheng Wang</a>, and an intern at Baidu NLP group.<br><br>

When I am not doing NLP, I like to work out, play guitar, and watch movies.<br>
