Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Chenyan Xiong](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/). My primary research interests are exploring novel ways to efficiently train and apply large language models in sample-limited and computation-limited scenarios. I am currently working on **data valuation**, hopefully derived from **model preference**, for a more efficient pre-training procedure.

Previously, I graduated from the Tsinghua University in 2023 with a major in Computer Science and Technology. I was honored to be a member of [THUNLP](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), working closely with [Dr. Tianyu Gao](https://gaotianyu.xyz/about/) and [Dr. Zhengyan Zhang](https://zzy14.github.io/) in prompting and few-shot learning. I was a research intern at [UWNLP](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp), advised by [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) and an intern at Baidu NLP group.

When I am not doing research, I like to work out, play guitar, and watch movies.
